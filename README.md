## Useful Commands

- `yarn build` - Build all packages including the Storybook site
- `yarn dev` - Run all packages locally and preview with Storybook
- `yarn lint` - Lint all packages
- `yarn clean` - Clean up all `node_modules` and `dist` folders (runs each package's clean script)

## Turborepo

[Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) is a high-performance build system for JavaScript and TypeScript codebases. It was designed after the workflows used by massive software engineering organizations to ship code at scale. Turborepo abstracts the complex configuration needed for monorepos and provides fast, incremental builds with zero-configuration remote caching.

Using Turborepo simplifes managing your design system monorepo, as you can have a single lint, build, test, and release process for all packages. [Learn more](https://vercel.com/blog/monorepos-are-changing-how-teams-build-software) about how monorepos improve your development workflow.

## Apps & Packages

This Turborepo includes the following packages and applications:

- `apps/docs`: Component documentation site with Storybook
- `packages/ui`: Shared React components
- `packages/react-utils`: Shared React utilities
- `packages/tsconfig`: Shared `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the Turborepo
- `packages/eslint-config-custom`: ESLint preset

Each package and app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Yarn Workspaces enables us to "hoist" dependencies that are shared between packages to the root `package.json`. This means smaller `node_modules` folders and a better local dev experience. To install a dependency for the entire monorepo, use the `-W` workspaces flag with `yarn add`.

This example sets up your `.gitignore` to exclude all generated files, other folders like `node_modules` used to store your dependencies.

### Compilation

To make the core library code work across all browsers, we need to compile the raw TypeScript and React code to plain JavaScript. We can accomplish this with `tsup`, which uses `esbuild` to greatly improve performance.

Running `yarn build` from the root of the Turborepo will run the `build` command defined in each package's `package.json` file. Turborepo runs each `build` in parallel and caches & hashes the output to speed up future builds.

For `ui`, the `build` command is the following:

```bash
tsup src/index.tsx --format esm,cjs --dts --external react
```

`tsup` compiles `src/index.tsx`, which exports all of the components in the design system, into both ES Modules and CommonJS formats as well as their TypeScript types. The `package.json` for `ui` then instructs the consumer to select the correct format:

```json:ui/package.json
{
  "name": "ui",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "./dist/index.js",
  "module": "./dist/index.mjs",
  "types": "./dist/index.d.ts",
  "sideEffects": false,
}
```

Run `yarn build` to confirm compilation is working correctly. You should see a folder `ui/dist` which contains the compiled output.

```bash
ui
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dist
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.d.ts  <-- Types
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js    <-- CommonJS version
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.mjs   <-- ES Modules version
```

## Components

Each file inside of `ui/src` is a component inside our design system. For example:

```tsx:ui/src/Link.tsx
import * as React from "react";

interface LinkProps extends React.AnchorHTMLAttributes<HTMLAnchorElement> {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  href: string;
}

export const Link = (props: LinkProps) => {
  const { children, href, ...rest } = props;

  if (rest.target === "_blank") {
    rest.rel = "noopener noreferrer";
  }

  return (
    <a href={href} {...rest}>
      üöÄ{children}üöÄ
    </a>
  );
};

Link.displayName = 'Link'
```

When adding a new file, ensure the component is also exported from the entry `index.tsx` file:

```tsx:ui/src/index.tsx
import * as React from "react";
export { Link, type LinkProps } from "./Link";
// Add new component exports here
```

## Storybook

Storybook provides us with an interactive UI playground for our components. This allows us to preview our components in the browser and instantly see changes when developing locally. This example preconfigures Storybook to:

- Use Vite to bundle stories instantly (in milliseconds)
- Automatically find any stories inside the `stories/` folder
- Support using module path aliases like `ui` for imports
- Write MDX for component documentation pages

For example, here's the included Story for our `Link` component:

```js:apps/docs/stories/link.stories.mdx
import { Link } from "ui/src";
import { Meta, Story, Preview, Props } from '@storybook/addon-docs/blocks';

<Meta title="Components/Link" component={Link} />

# Link

Make your links blazingly fast.

## Props

<Props of={Link} />

## Examples

<Preview>
  <Story name="Default">
    <Link href="https://storybook.js.org">Learn Storybook</Link>
  </Story>
</Preview>
```

This example includes a few helpful Storybook scripts:

- `yarn dev`: Starts Storybook in dev mode with hot reloading at `localhost:6006`
- `yarn build`: Builds the Storybook UI and generates the static HTML files
- `yarn preview-storybook`: Starts a local server to view the generated Storybook UI
